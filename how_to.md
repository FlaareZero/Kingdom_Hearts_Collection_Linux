# Kingdom Hearts 1.5+2.5 , 2.8 HD Remix and Kingdom Hearts 3 on Wine Lutris / Heroic Games Launcher

WARNING: I'm using a repacked copy of Kingdom Hearts 1.5+2.5, 2.8 and Kingdom Hearts 3, since I've already got them for my PS3 + PS4.
I STRONGLY ADVISE YOU to buy the original game from the Epic Games Store, and follow the guide by using Lutris or Heroic Games Launcher. Your choice.

## Prerequisites:
- Lutris - In case you're using the Repacked version 
- Heroic Games Launcher - In case you own a copy of the game

- In case you're using Lutris - Wine Lutris 6.4 and 6.10-2 are the recommended and known to work
(For Legendary or Heroic Games Launcher, ProtonGE works perfectly fine, although you can use the 2 versions mentioned above as well)
- A custom kernel - For better performances and reliability 
(For Ubuntu LTS I suggest XanMod LTS, which is the one I'm using)(For Arch, Zen Kernel)

You can also use the provided one, but make sure to enable ESync, if the Distro you're using supports it [Here for more info](https://github.com/lutris/docs/blob/master/HowToEsync.md)
